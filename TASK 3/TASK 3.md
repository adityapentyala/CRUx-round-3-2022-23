**TASK 3 PROBLEM STATEMENT**

SEMI SUPERVISED LEARNING

Dataset: CIFAR-100 (with 33% randomly labeled data, rest unlabeled)

1. Understand and implement semi-supervised learning: self-learning.
2. Use any VGG architecture.
3. Use only the functional/modular API in TensorFlow (or) PyTorch. Create a callback (TF) that allows you to stop training 
   if your model isn't improving, or build it in your training loop in PyTorch (or use pytorch lightning if time allows you 
   to learn that).
4. Use keras-tuner or raytune for automating your hyperparameter tuning
